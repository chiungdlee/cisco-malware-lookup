# Malware URL Lookup Service

## Overview

This project provides a scalable malware URL lookup service. The system consists of three primary microservices: `auth-service`, `urlinfo-service`, and `update-service`. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, and the services are deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Helm charts. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Kubernetes CronJobs are used to ensure scalability and reliability.

## Components

### 1. `auth-service`
- **Purpose**: Provides authentication and issues JWT tokens for secure access to the other services.
- **Location**: `src/auth.py`, Helm chart in `helm/charts/auth`

### 2. `urlinfo-service`
- **Purpose**: Checks if a given URL is safe or potentially malicious based on data stored in the database.
- **Location**: `src/app.py`, Helm chart in `helm/charts/urlinfo`
- **Scaling**: Configured with HPA to handle varying loads.

### 3. `update-service`
- **Purpose**: Periodically fetches the latest list of malicious URLs from an external source and updates the database.
- **Location**: `src/update_service.py`, Helm chart in `helm/charts/update`
- **Execution**: Triggered by a Kubernetes CronJob defined in `cronjob.yaml`.

### 4. **Infrastructure**
- **Terraform**: Used to provision and manage cloud resources, including AKS, MySQL database, and more.
- **Ansible**: Used for additional configuration management post-deployment.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Scalability
The application stores URL data in an external MySQL database. The database can be easily scaled using Terraform, which allows us to adjust the database's capacity based on the load. This ensures that our system can handle an increasing amount of data without performance degradation.

### 2. Request Scalability
The number of incoming requests might exceed the capacity of a single system. To handle this, the system is deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which provides the ability to scale horizontally. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or other metrics. If the cluster gets flooded, we can customize Terraform to add more nodes to the node pool, ensuring the system remains responsive.

### 3. Efficient Scheduling with CronJobs
Instead of running the update-service in an infinite loop to fetch updates every 10 minutes, we use Kubernetes CronJobs. The CronJob schedules the fetch operation at regular intervals, ensuring that updates are performed efficiently without the need for a long-running process. This approach reduces resource usage and improves reliability.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Terraform
- Ansible

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/malware_url_lookup.git
```

2. **Build and push Docker images**:
```sh
    docker build -t your-docker-repo/auth-service:latest -f Dockerfile.auth .
    docker push your-docker-repo/auth-service:latest

    docker build -t your-docker-repo/urlinfo-service:latest -f Dockerfile.urlinfo .
    docker push your-docker-repo/urlinfo-service:latest

    docker build -t your-docker-repo/update-service:latest -f Dockerfile.update .
    docker push your-docker-repo/update-service:latest
```

3. **Provision infrastructure with Terraform**:
```sh
    cd terraform/environments/dev
    terraform init
    terraform apply -auto-approve
```
4. **Deploy services with Helm:**:
```sh
    helm upgrade --install auth-service helm/charts/auth --set image.repository=your-docker-repo/auth-service,image.tag=latest
    helm upgrade --install urlinfo-service helm/charts/urlinfo --set image.repository=your-docker-repo/urlinfo-service,image.tag=latest
    helm upgrade --install update-service helm/charts/update --set image.repository=your-docker-repo/update-service,image.tag=latest
```

5. **Apply CronJob**:
```sh
    kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
```

6. **Apply HPA**:
```sh
    kubectl apply -f helm/charts/urlinfo/templates/hpa.yaml
```
